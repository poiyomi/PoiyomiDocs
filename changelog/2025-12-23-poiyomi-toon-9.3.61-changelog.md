This update includes more bug fixes. **In case you missed it, Poiyomi Toon has been graduated to version 9.3. See the previous update patch notes for more info.**

Sorry these haven't been on VCC but honestly I'm glad they haven't been because there would have been a bunch of bugs. That, and I don't wanna mess people up right before Christmas haha. We'll mess em up for New Years instead.

The Toon version is now available to download in our Discord server. Please test it out! As soon as we can confirm this version is bug-free, this will be the version released on the VCC, GitHub, and on BOOTH.

Poiyomi Pro Users: Download the latest Pro version from [pro.poiyomi.com](https://pro.poiyomi.com) by logging in with your Patreon account.
