## Toon 9.2.76

### Changes
- Fixed a bug where random generation was causing weird patterns in things like Glitter.
- Fixed duplicate properties showing up in Decal 3.
- Updated Light Volumes includes to the newest release. No real changes though.
- Added Documentation links to Uzumore.
- Masking options are now under a central masking menu in Dissolve.
- Fixed a bug with Vertex IDs not being read correctly.

## Pro 9.3.46

### Changes
- Added Documentation links to ShatterWave and Geometric Dissolve.
- Tessellated: I had to remove Vertex IDs from Tessellated shaders. I don't think this will cause any issues, but if you're part of the 0.001% using those shaders and notice anything, please let me know.
