This update includes some bug fixes to the shader from the previous update... turns out making compilation faster broke Fog. The Toon version is now available in the VCC Repository, GitHub, and on BOOTH.

### Fixes
- Fixed issues with the shader breaking Fog.
  - It's still faster compilation time, but just a little bit slower now.
  - It will say variants have gone up, but they're only for vertex shader variants so it's not nearly as bad.
  - Times should still be really improved, but let me know your results in the Discord.
- Thry Editor: Fixed a critical error with Presets messing up settings.
