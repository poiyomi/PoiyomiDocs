This update includes more bug fixes. **In case you missed it, Poiyomi Toon has been graduated to version 9.3. See the previous update patch notes for more info.**

The Toon version is now available to download in our Discord server. Please test it out! As soon as we can confirm this version is bug-free, this will be the version released on the VCC, GitHub, and on BOOTH.

Poiyomi Pro Users: Download the latest Pro version from [pro.poiyomi.com](https://pro.poiyomi.com) by logging in with your Patreon account.

### Changes
- Fix to hopefully mitigate Vertex Options messing with Projectors and Z-fighting.
- Fixed missing UI elements in the Toon shader.
- Emission now works correctly with Lil Fur.
