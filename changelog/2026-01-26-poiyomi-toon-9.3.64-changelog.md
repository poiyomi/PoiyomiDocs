This is a small update adding fake shadows support when translating from lilToon to Poiyomi. The Toon version is now available in the VCC Repository, GitHub, and on BOOTH.

Poiyomi Pro Users: Download the latest Pro version from [pro.poiyomi.com](https://pro.poiyomi.com) by logging in with your Patreon account.

*You can safely delay updating to this version as it introduces very small changes. Although if you use the LilToon to Poiyomi translation tool, it's recommended to update to this version.*
