This update includes some minor changes to help fight against 64 slot crashes. You can download it now from [pro.poiyomi.com](https://pro.poiyomi.com) by logging in via your Patreon account.

### Changes
- The 64 Texture crash should not happen as often now.
  - It will still happen it'll just be more your fault for actually enabling too many things instead of just updating to a newer version and crashing.
- Small rework of the icons at the bottom of the material inspector.
