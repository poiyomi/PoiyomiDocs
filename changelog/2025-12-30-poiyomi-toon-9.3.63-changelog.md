## This is a major release!

**Poiyomi Toon is now on version 9.3 LTS. See previous changelogs for the major changes introduced!**

This update contains some final changes and fixes for the LTS release of 9.3 for the VCC. The Toon version is now available in the VCC Repository, GitHub, and on BOOTH.

Poiyomi Pro Users: Download the latest Pro version from [pro.poiyomi.com](https://pro.poiyomi.com) by logging in with your Patreon account.

*Provided there are no more critical bugs discovered, this will be the last major update for 9.3! Early development on Poiyomi 10.0 has already started and I'll be providing updates on Discord and my socials as development progresses.*

### Changes
- Fixed Multilayer Math normal blending not working.
- Fixed some things that shouldn't have been included.
