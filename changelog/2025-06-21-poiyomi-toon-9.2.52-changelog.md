This patch resolves a typo found in the Shader and updates Thry Editor version to resolve a few bugs. The Toon version is now available in the VCC Repository, GitHub, and on BOOTH.

### Fixes
- Fixed a typo in the Toon 9.1 shaders being named as `oiyomi Toon` instead of `Poiyomi Toon`.
- Updated Thry Editor to v2.66.7.
