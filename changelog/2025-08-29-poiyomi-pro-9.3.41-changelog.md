This update to the Pro shader contains some new features (including a new Particle shader!) and some new UI improvements. You can download it now from [pro.poiyomi.com](https://pro.poiyomi.com) by logging in via your Patreon account.

There may be bugs in this build as a lot of things were changed behind the scenes. Please test it out!

### Added
- Added a new Particle Shader that spawns from the surface of the mesh.
	- Two Pass and One Pass versions are available.
- Two Pass now supports Global Masking per pass.
- `_UdonForceSceneLighting` has been implemented to allow Worlds to turn off Avatar light limitations, as recommended by lilxyzw.

### Changes
- New curve editor in the Shader UI.
- Some vectors can be linked similar to how the Transform scale works in the Unity Inspector.

## Coming Soon
- Presets for the Particle shader.
- Presets for the Two Pass shader.
- Scaling float that can be animated so particles scale properly.

## Known Issues
- No implementation of `poiRand2` in the Pro Shader.
- UI broken in `2nd Pass` section. Possibly related to new Global Masking options.
- Crash when AO is set to a Global Mask and AudioLink is enabled.
