This update contains a significant amount of bug fixes and is recommended for all users. The Toon version is now available in the VCC Repository, GitHub, and on BOOTH.

See the previous blog post for an assortment of major features that were added in the last update.

### Changes
- The Color Grading texture now has a Thry Gradient Editor UI.
- **Outline Color Adjust is now 4 separate floats instead of a float4** so it's easier to animate individual values. Documentation has been updated.
  - **This will break existing settings!!**
  - Shader Translator was adjusted to accommodate this change.
- `Ignore Directional` in Light Data has been renamed to `Ignore Directional Lights` for clarity.
- Removed an extra visible Hue Shift checkbox from the Emission 2 Color Adjust. Why was that even there in the first place? The world may never know...
- Gamma can now be used with Global Masks.

### Fixes
- Fixed Rim Bias issue when Locking the Material.
  - The Bias wasn't working the same between Locked and Unlocked.
- Fixed an issue with the Pixel Normal Mix in Reflections & Specular not functioning correctly.
- Fixed a typo in the Material Property name for Gamma.
  - The Material Property name in question is now `_MainGamma` instead of `_MainGammma`.
- Fixed an issue with the Color Adjust Mask's Alpha value from being used with Gamma.
- Fixed an issue with Stylized Reflections not correctly detecting Reflection Probes in Worlds.
