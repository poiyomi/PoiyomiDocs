This update contains additional improvements and is recommended for all users. The Toon version is now available in the VCC Repository, GitHub, and on BOOTH.

See the previous blog posts for an assortment of major features and fixes that were implemented in the last few updates.

### Changes
- `Clip 0 Width` in **Outlines** is now enabled by default.
  - As per the Documentation, `Clip 0 Width` removes the Outline from being drawn when the Width is set to `0`.
- Added Shader Translation parameters for Multilayer Math AO.
  - As a side-effect, new properties have been exposed in Multilayer Math to support this.
### Fixes
- Fixed an issue with the Outlines Section Header being marked as Animated, even though it's not supposed to be.
  - If you are attempting to animate Outlines, please animate the properties instead!
- Fixed a shader translation inconsistency with **Outlines** and `Clip 0 Width`.
- Fixed a problem with AudioLink options in **Vertex Options** unable to have access to the `Volume` and `Smoothing` Bands and modifiers.
- Fixed a bug causing **Decal** `Alpha` to be applied twice after being translated.

### Pro Changes

*Grab the latest package of Pro from the Discord Server.*

- Fixed a typo in Geometric Dissolve where the `Shape Type` property was incorrectly labeled as `Gradient Type`.
