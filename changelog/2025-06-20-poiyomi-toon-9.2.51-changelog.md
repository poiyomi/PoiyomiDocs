This patch includes a critical bug fix and is recommended for all users! The Toon version is now available in the VCC Repository, GitHub, and on BOOTH.

### Fixes
- Rebuilt all shaders and fixed the Shader Optimizer from locking due to a typo in Thry Editor's code.
- Fixed a bug where two of the Vertex Options Mask Channels in **Basics & Fun** weren't rendering correctly in the UI.

### Known Issues
- The 9.1 Toon shaders located at `.poiyomi/Old Versions/9.1` are mis-spelled as `oiyomi Toon` instead of `Poiyomi Toon`.
- Section Presets don't populate across versions. [ThryEditor Issue #142](https://github.com/Thryrallo/ThryEditor/issues/142)
