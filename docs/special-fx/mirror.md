The Mirror/Cmaera Visibility section is a very simple section that controls whether the shader should appear in VRChat Mirrors or not.

This can be used for very niche effects, such as if you want only a specific texture or effect to only show when the shader is being viewed from a Mirror, or from a Camera.

## Mode

- `Type`: **Dropdown**, Options: `VRC`/`Generic`

Sets the behavioral mode for the Mirror and Camera visibility.

- `VRC`: Changes settings that cater to VRChat-specific functionality.
- `Generic`: Changes settings that are for general usages, with limited options available.

### Normal (Outside Mirror/Camera)
