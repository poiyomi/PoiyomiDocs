Flipbook is a classic feature that allows images from a Texture Array to be played as an animation on the Material. This can be a way to play GIFs or a specific 2D animation that either animates in a loop or in a specified pattern.

Flipbooks use a `Texture Array`, which is a special type of file that consists of a multiple set of images that are sorted in a specified sequence. They can be created in Unity using ThryEditor TextureArray Utility.

:::warning
Texture Arrays can quickly add up to your VRAM consumption depending on the resolution and the amount of images used in your array! Please keep this in mind when creating your Texture Arrays.
:::

## Color & Alpha

- `Type`: <PropertyIcon name="color" />**Color**

Defines the color tint and alpha value (transparency) of the flipbook. This allows the flipbook to be tinted, or to blend only partially. Can generally be left at the default values.

## Texture Array

- `Type`: <PropertyIcon name="texture" />**Texture Array** (`sRGB = On`)

Main Texture Slot to specify your Flipbook Texture Array. This uses a [Texture2DArray <FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-square-arrow-up-right"/>](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Texture2DArray.html) texture to store multiple flipbook frames.

Texture Arrays can be created from GIF files imported to unity, or a series of single frames. By right clicking the file (or files) to be made into a texture array and selecting `Thry -> Gif 2 Texture Array` or `Thry -> Images 2 Texture Array`, the texture array will be created. Make sure to take note of the "Slices" value, which is the number of frames in the array.

Note that Texture2DArrays can get very big very quickly - make sure your source image files are low resolution, such as 512x512 or lower.

:::warning Automatic Conversion Warning
Attaching a GIF into the texture slot will automatically convert the file into a Texture Array. Please be aware that if your images are of large size (or have many frames), **Unity will freeze for a few moments** while it auto-converts the GIF.

## Mask

- `Type`: <PropertyIcon name="texture" />**Data** Texture (`sRGB = Off`)

Defines where on the UV the flipbook can be applied. Black indicates the flipbook can not be applied, while white indicates the flipbook can be applied. If this texture is not defined, the flipbook can apply everywhere.

### Global Mask

- `Type`: <PropertyIcon name="dropdown" />**Dropdown**, Options: `Off`/`1R`/`1G`/`1B`/`1A`/`2R`/`2G`/`2B`/`2A`/`3R`/`3G`/`3B`/`3A`/`4R`/`4G`/`4B`/`4A`

Select which [Global Mask](/docs/modifiers/global-masks.md) to use for the Flipbook overall.

:::note
Expand the **Mask** slot to see this property.

## Tiling

- `Type`: <PropertyIcon name="dropdown" />**Dropdown**, Options: `Off`/`Tiled (Seamless)`/`Tiled (Sprite)`

Sets the Tiling mode to use on the Flipbook.

## Blending

- `Type`: <PropertyIcon name="dropdown" />**Dropdown**, Options: `Replace`/`Darken`/`Multiply`/`Lighten`/`Screen`/`Subtract`/`Add`/`Overlay`/`Mixed`

Controls how to blend the Flipbook with the Material.

## Alpha/Color Override

- `Type`: <PropertyIcon name="dropdown" />**Dropdown**, Options: `Off`/`Replace Alpha`/`Replace Alpha and Color`

Optional setting to control if the Color and/or Alpha of the Flipbook should replace the final Color and/or Alpha. This allows the Flipbook to be rendered on top of the material, even if the material is transparent OR if the Flipbook should override the base color as well.

## Replace

- `Type`: <PropertyIcon name="floatrange" />**Float**, Range: `0.0 - 1.0`

Replaces the base color with the Flipbook.

:::tip
You may animate this slider to toggle the Flipbook on the Material. Animating the [Section Header](/docs/general/locking.md#section-header-checkboxes) will not work!
:::

## Emission Strength

- `Type`: <PropertyIcon name="floatrange" />**Float**, Range: `0.0 - 20.0`

How much emission the flipbook should have. This stacks with whatever blending options are selected.

## FPS

- `Type`: <PropertyIcon name="float" />**Float**

How many frames per second the flipbook should play if "Manual Frame Control" is not enabled. This is used to determine how fast the flipbook should play. The default is 30 FPS.

## Frame Offset

- `Type`: <PropertyIcon name="float" />**Float**

Sets an offset for the frames.

## Positioning

### Pan UV

- `Type`: <PropertyIcon name="float2" />**Vector2**

Sets a panning speed on the Flipbook.

### Scale / Offset 

- `Type`: <PropertyIcon name="float4" />**Vector4**

Determines the Scale (size) and Offset (position) of the Flipbook. The first two values are the scale (in X/Y) and the second two are the position (in X/Y). This allows placing the Flipbook like a Decal.

## Side Offset

- `Type`: <PropertyIcon name="float4" />**Vector4**

Side Offset allows stretching and squishing the Flipbook in the X and Y directions. Each value can be positive or negative values, with positive values stretching the Flipbook in that direction, and negative values squishing the Flipbook in that direction.

The first two values the left and right offsets, and the second two are the top and bottom offsets.

### Rotation

- `Type`: <PropertyIcon name="floatrange" />**Float**, Range: `0.0 - 360.0`

How much to rotate the Flipbook by, in degrees.

### Rotation Speed

- `Type`: <PropertyIcon name="float" />**Float**

A constant rotation speed applied to the decal. A value of `180` will rotate the decal once per second, which is quite fast.

## Manual Frame Control

- `Type`: <PropertyIcon name="toggle" />**Toggle**

Determines whether the Flipbook should be manually controlled. If this is enabled, the Flipbook will not play automatically, and the frame must manually advance via animations. This is useful for dynamically controlling the speed of the Flipbook, or using the Flipbook to show specific frames.

### Current Frame

- `Type`: <PropertyIcon name="float" />**Float**

Determines which frame to show. Only works when the above toggle `Manual Frame Control` is enabled.

## Start/End Frame Loop

- `Type`: <PropertyIcon name="toggle" />**Toggle**

When enabled, the settings in this area can be used to clamp which frame the Flipbook should start and end from.

### Start Frame

- `Type`: <PropertyIcon name="float" />**Float**

Sets the first frame in the Flipbook.

### End Frame

- `Type`: <PropertyIcon name="float" />**Float**

Sets the last frame in the Flipbook before it loops back to the beginning Start Frame.

## Frame Crossfade

- `Type`: <PropertyIcon name="toggle" />**Toggle**

Enables or disables crossfading. This is used to smoothly transition between frames, which can be useful for reducing the number of frames needed in the Flipbook.

### Fade Range

- `Type`: <PropertyIcon name="floatclamped" />**Multislider**, Range: `0.0 - 1.0`

Determines how much to crossfade the Flipbook between frames. Defined by a start and stop value.

## Hue Shift

- `Type`: <PropertyIcon name="toggle" />**Toggle**

Enable or Disable the Hue Shifting functionality.

### Color Space

- `Type`: <PropertyIcon name="dropdown" />**Dropdown**, Options: `OKLab`/`HSV`

Choice of Color Space to use for the Hue Shift. By default, it will be set to `OKLab`.

Learn about the difference of Color Spaces as documented here in [Color Adjust](/docs/color-and-normals/color-adjust.md#oklab-vs-hsv).

### Select or Shift

- `Type`: <PropertyIcon name="dropdown" />**Dropdown**, Options: `Hue Select`/`Hue Shift`
  - Default: `Hue Shift`

This dropdown allows you to select how the Color Adjustment should behave when the Hue Shift is used. By default, this will be set to `Hue Shift`.

<details>
<summary><b>Select or Shift Options</b></summary>

- `Hue Select`: Directly applies the selected Hue as an override to the entire Flipbook.
- `Hue Shift`: Only tints the Flipbook based on the lerped value. This is the default behavior.

</details>

### Shift Speed

- `Type`: <PropertyIcon name="float" />**Float**

How much to constantly shift the hue with time. A value of 1 will result in a full hue shift cycle every 20 seconds.

### Hue Shift

- `Type`: <PropertyIcon name="floatrange" />**Float**, Range: `0.0 - 1.0`

How much to shift the flipbook around the hue circle.

This value is circular, and will have the same result at 0 and 1.
