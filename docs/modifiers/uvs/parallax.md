Parallax Heightmapping is a feature that can simulate large bumps and protrusions on a Material. It utilizes a specialized linear texture that determines how much depth there is on the Material.

This feature is similar to the Height Map function found in the Unity Standard Shader, but with some more options available for additional tweaks.

:::caution
Parallax Heightmapping is an expensive feature due to the way it works. Because of this, we recommend you utilize the [Normal Map](https://www.poiyomi.com/color-and-normals/main#normal-map) feature instead as it is both more performance-friendly and higher quality.
:::

## Applies To

- `Type`: **Dropdown**, Options: `UV0`/`UV1`/`UV2`/`UV3`/`Panosphere`/`World Pos`/`Local Pos`/`Polar UV`/`Distorted UV`

Choice of UV to use for the Parallax Heightmapping feature.

## Heightmap

- `Type`: **Data** Texture (`sRGB = OFF`)

The main Height Map texture slot, defining where the bumps and protrusions should be simulated. Darker colors in Grayscale will yield larger depth.

## Mask

- `Type`: **Data** Texture (`sRGB = OFF`)

Optional Mask that can be used to constrain the Height Map to only affect a specified area.

## Strength

- `Type`: **Float**, Range: `0.0 - 1.0`

Determines the strength of the Height Map. Higher values will yield larger depth.

## Curvature U

- `Type`: **Float**, Range: `0.0 - 100.0`

Adjusts the curvature of the parallax on the Local Horizontal axis.

## Curvature V

- `Type`: **Float**, Range: `0.0 - 30.0`

Adjusts the curvature of the parallax on the Local Vertical axis.

## Steps Min

- `Type`: **Float**, Range: `0.0 - 128.0`

Minimum amount of parallax steps to generate at the beginning of the parallax.

## Steps Max

- `Type`: **Float**, Range: `0.0 - 128.0`

Maximum amount of parallax steps to generate at the end of the parallax.

## Curvature Bias

- `Type`: **Float**, Range: `0.0 - 1.0`

Adjusts the bias of the curvature when rendering the parallax.
