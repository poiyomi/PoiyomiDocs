Panosphere is a UV projection mode that is selectable in various sections of the shader. It samples the texture using the Camera/View Direction instead of the mesh's native UV layout. This makes the effect look "stuck to the world" rather than to the triangulated layout by projecting the texture onto a large sphere within the shader.

This section houses the global settings for Panosphere. To use it, select it as a UV option in supported sections of the shader.

## Stereo Enabled

- `Type`: <PropertyIcon name="toggle" />**Toggle**
  - Default: `Off`

When enabled, switches the sampling logic to per-eye so that the left and right eyes see slighly different directions or sampled different regions of the stereoscopic panorama.

If disabled, both eyes would see the same monoscopic sample.

## Perspective Correct (VR)

- `Type`: <PropertyIcon name="toggle" />**Toggle**
  - Default: `On`

This makes the UV lookup use the actual eye's view ray rather than a naive direction computed from a singular center camera. This reduces warping and rotation artifacts that show up with view-mapped effects in head-tracked VR.
