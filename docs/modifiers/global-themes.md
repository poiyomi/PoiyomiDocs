Global Themes provide a central place to change colors throughout the shader. When configured, you can set any **Color** property in the Material to use a Theme Color as defined by the user.

## Usage in the Shader

To use Global Themes in the Shader, set the Colors you prefer to use in each Theme Color.

Then, set whichever **Color** property you wish to use a Global Theme by selecting the dropdown located next to the **Color** property. The dropdown will look something like this:

<a target="_blank" href="/img/modifiers/GlobalTheme_Selector.png">
<img src="/img/modifiers/GlobalTheme_Selector.png" alt="Global Theme Selection next to Color Property" width="700px"/>
</a>
