BlackLight Masking allows you to create distance-based effects that appear based on specific set of Keys. It works by only showing effects when a specific Light Source (set to the Color **Black**) has it's `Intensity` set to match the `Key` as defined in the BlackLight Masking to show the effect.

There are 4 BlackLight Masks permissible per Material.

:::warning Required Setup
To use BlackLight Masking, you must set the following on a **Point Light Source** that you intend to use to react to the BlackLight Mask:
- `Intensity`, which will act as your **Key**.
- `Color` set to **Black**.
- `Mode` set to **Realtime**.
- `Render Mode` set to **Not Important**. *If this is not set, the BlackLight Mask will not work!*
:::
