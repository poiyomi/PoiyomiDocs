# Rim Lighting

**Rim Lighting** can be used to add a highlight or glow around the edges (or center) of a material. It uses the angle between your view and the normal of the surface to define the intensity of the effect.

Rim Lighting is sometimes referred to in conjunction with or as Fresnel, in reference to the [Fresnel Effect](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/StandardShaderFresnel.html).

*Demonstration of 3 different Rim Lighting effects with low sharpness (left), high sharpness (middle), and colored rim lighting (right).*

## Style

- `Type`: **Dropdown**, Options: `Poiyomi`/`UTS2`/`LilToon`

Choose the style of Rim Lighting that you wish to use.

### Poiyomi

Uses the in-house Rim style made exclusively for Poiyomi Shaders.

### UTS2

Uses the Rim style that is known in Unity-Chan Toon Shader 2.

### LilToon

Uses the Rim style that is well known in LilToon Shader.

## Mask & Bias

- `Type`: **Data** Texture (`sRGB: OFF`)

A texture overlaid on the mesh defining the intensity of the rim lighting at each point. It should generally be black and white, as only its value (specifically the red channel value) will be used, not the color.

When expanded, the Rim Mask texture has options for **Tiling** and **Offset**. The assigned **UV Map** and the **Panning** of the Rim Mask can be adjusted.

### Bias Intensity

Bias of the Mask Intensity.

## Color & Blending

*Demonstration of the Rim Lighting Color & Blending options.*

### Rim Texture

- `Type`: **Color** Texture (`sRGB: ON`)

A texture overlaid on the mesh defining the color of the rim lighting.

When expanded, the Rim Texture has options for **Tiling** and **Offset**. The assigned **UV Map** and the **Panning** of the Rim Texture can be adjusted.

### Color

- `Type`: **Color**

The Color of your Rim Lighting. Blended with the base color.

This color is blended multiplicative with the Rim Texture, if defined.

:::info
This will instead be an HDR Color field if using `LilToon` Rim Lighting mode.
:::

### Blend Mode

- `Type`: **Dropdown**, Options: `Add`/`Replace`/`Multiply`/`Mixed`/`Screen`

Choice of how the Rim Lighting will blend with the base texture.

### Blend Alpha

- `Type`: **Float**, Range: `0.0 - 1.0`

Controls the Alpha visibility of the Rim Lighting. `0` is invisible, while `1` is fully visible.

### Mix Base Color

- `Type`: **Float**, Range: `0.0 - 1.0`

Controls how much the Rim Lighting's Color will blend with the Base Color.

### Brightness

- `Type`: **Float**, Range: `0.0 - 10.0`

Controls how bright the Rim Lighting will be overall.

### Emission

- `Type`: **Float**, Range: `0.0 - 20.0`

Controls the emission value of the rim lighting color. Emission emulates a part of a material that produces light, and adds directly on top of the base color.

Total emission values above 1 will generally cause glow in worlds with bloom.

## Shape Controls

<PoiVideo url='/vid/shading/RL_ShapeControls.mp4'/>

*Demonstration of the Rim Lighting Shape Controls.*

### Width

- `Type`: **Float**, Range: `0.0 - 1.0`

Controls the width of the rim lighting. Affects how far from the edge (or center) the rim extends.

### Sharpness

- `Type`: **Float**, Range: `0.0 - 1.0`

Controls the sharpness of the transition between minimum and maximum rim lighting. At `0`, the rim will be a gradual transition, with the maximum color only present at the very outer edge. As **Rim Sharpness** increases, the maximum color extends further toward the edge as defined by the [Rim Width](#width). At `1`, there is a sharp transition between no rim lighting and rim lighting.

### Rim Power

- `Type`: **Float**, Range: `0.0 - 10.0`

Controls how intense the Rim Lighting has an effect.

### Normal Strength

- `Type`: **Float**, Range: `0.0 - 1.0`

Controls how the Rim Lighting will blend with your Normals. A value of `0` ignores your Normals, while a value of `1` will fully blend within your Normals.

### Invert Rim

- `Type`: **Checkbox**

Inverts the Rim Lighting direction. When unchecked, rim lighting goes from "outside-in" (facing away from viewer has maximum intensity). When checked, rim lighting goes from "inside-out" (facing toward viewer has maximum intensity).

## Light Direction Mask

- `Type`: **Checkbox**

Enables the ability to mask the Rim Lighting to a Lighting Direction Mask, whether that would be Custom or to use the Shadow Map.

### Light Falloff Type

- `Type`: **Dropdown**, Options: `Shadow Map`/`Custom`

Choice of the Light Falloff Map it's going to use as a Mask.

### Invert Shadow Mask

- `Type`: **Checkbox**

Inverts the values of the Shadow Mask

### Shadow Mask Strength

Controls the intensity of that Mask.

### Shrink In Shadow

Lowers the size of the Rim Light Width in the Masked area.

## Hue Shift

### Shift Speed

- `Type`: **Float**

Sets the speed at which the rim color's hue value is shifted. At a value of `1`, it will go through a complete cycle of the color wheel once every 20 seconds.

### Hue Shift

- `Type`: **Float**, Range: `0.0 - 1.0`

A fixed value by which to hue shift the material. At values of `0` and `1`, there will be no change to the material. In between, the hue will shift through the color wheel.

## Alpha & Global Masking

### Apply to Alpha

- `Type`: **Dropdown**, Options: `Off`/`Add`/`Multiply`

Choice to apply the Rim Lighting to the Material Alpha.

### Apply to Alpha Blend

- `Type`: **Float**, Range: `0.0 - 1.0`

Controls how much to Apply the Rim to your Alpha.

### Global Mask

- `Type`: **Dropdown**, Options: `Off`/`1R`/`1G`/`1B`/`1A`/`2R`/`2G`/`2B`/`2A`/`3R`/`3G`/`3B`/`3A`/`4R`/`4G`/`4B`/`4A`

Choose to use a [Global Mask](../modifiers/global-masks.md) to constrain the Rim Lighting to the specified Mask instead. Overrides [Mask & Bias](#mask--bias).

### Apply to Global Mask

- `Type`: **Dropdown**, Options: `Off`/`1R`/`1G`/`1B`/`1A`/`2R`/`2G`/`2B`/`2A`/`3R`/`3G`/`3B`/`3A`/`4R`/`4G`/`4B`/`4A`

Allows you to add the currently set Rim Lighting setup to be applied to an existing Global Mask of your choice.

## AudioLink

:::info
This section allows control of the Rim Lighting through [AudioLink](../audio-link/audio-link.md). It will only be exposed when AudioLink is activated on the Material.
