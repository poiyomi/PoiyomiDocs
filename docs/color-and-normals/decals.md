Decals are used to place images onto a UV with specific location, rotation, and blending. 4 independent Decal sections are available, with extensive base and AudioLink options.

They can be used to add high resolution designs and details onto a mesh without the base texture having to be higher resolution, or to replace base textures entirely. This can allow fun and unique ways to decorate your Avatar with logos, shapes, stickers, or even as a blush emote toggle.

*Example of 3 Decals placed on this Avatar's Jacket; a Poiyomi Shaders wordmark, the Poi Logo, and a Snowflake.*

## Decal RGBA Mask

- `Type`: **Data** Texture (`sRGB = OFF`)

A mask texture that defines where to place different decals. Each decal section can define which channel of the mask to sample from.

This texture defaults to pure white, so no masking will be applied with no texture defined.

## Decal Slot

- `Type`: **Checkbox**

Enables the mentioned Decal slot.

:::info Documentation Info
Each of the 4 decal sections (0, 1, 2, 3) have the following options listed below. They are independent of each other and colors are blended in order of ID, according to their blend operation. Decal Emissions are always added with one another when overlapping.
:::

### Positioning

:::tip
Decals supports the **Raycast** feature, which allows you to visually position a Decal on your Model without having to second-guess it's exact UV coordinates.

To use this feature, edit the Decal on your Material <u>directly from the Mesh</u> as shown here:

<PoiVideo url='/vid/color-and-normals/Decals_RaycastDemo.mp4' width='300px'/>

`Left-Click` on the **Raycast** button to enable the feature. Hover the Mouse over your Mesh to position it, then `Left-Click` again to finalize your placement.
:::

#### Position

- `Type`: **Vector2**

Where on the UV the decal's center should be.

#### Rotation

- `Type`: **Float**, Range: `0.0 - 360.0`

How much rotation to apply to the decal, around its center position.

#### Rotation Speed

- `Type`: **Float**

A constant roatation speed applied to the decal. A value of `180` will rotate the decal once per second.

#### Scale

- `Type`: **Vector2**

Scale of the decal, in UV space. `1.0, 1.0` would map the decal to the entire UV square.

#### Side Offset

- `Type`: **Vector4**

How much scale offset to define on each side of the decal.

#### Tiled

- `Type`: **Checkbox**

Whether or not the decal texture should be tiled. By default, decals are not tiled.

### Color

- `Type`: **Color**

Base color for the decal texture. This is blended multiplicative with the Decal.

### Decal

- `Type`: **Color** Texture (`sRGB = ON`)

The texture used for the decal. The alpha channel is used to define where the decal should be blended.

#### Mask Channel

- `Type`: **Dropdown**, Options: `R`/`G`/`B`/`A`

Which channel of the Decal RGBA mask to use for masking. ***Expand the [Decal](#decal) Texture Slot to see this property.***

### Emission Strength

- `Type`: **Float**, Range: `0.0 - 20.0`

How much Emission to apply from the Decal's Base Color. Higher values will yield a bloom-like effect in certain Worlds.

### Color Blend Mode

- `Type`: **Dropdown**, Options: `Replace`/`Darken`/`Multiply`/`Lighten`/`Screen`/`Subtract`/`Add`/`Overlay`/`Mixed`

Which blending operation to use for the Decal's base color.

These are the same blending operations used in Adobe Photoshop.

### Alpha Blend Mode

- `Type`: **Dropdown**
    - Main Options: `Off`/`Replace`/`Multiply`/`Add`/`Subtract`/`Min`/`Max`
    - Secondary Options: `Everywhere`/`Decal Bounds`

Which blending operation to use from the Decal's Alpha channel.

### Alpha

- `Type`: **Float**, Range: `0.0 - 1.0`

How much to apply the blended color to the base color.

:::tip
This slider can be used to hide and show a decal by animating it's value.
:::

### Depth

- `Type`: **Float**, Range: `-0.5 - 2.0`

How much parallax depth the decal should have. This can be used for layered parallax posters, or other unique designs.

### Hue Shift

- `Type`: **Checkbox**

Enable or Disable hue shifting of the Decal.

#### Shift Speed

- `Type`: **Float**

How much to constantly shift the decal hue with time. A value of 1 will result in a full hue shift cycle every 20 seconds.

#### Hue Shift

- `Type`: **Float**, Range: `0.0 - 1.0`

How much to shift the base color around the hue circle.

This value is circular, and will have the same result at `0` and `1`.

#### Hue Angle Power

- `Type`: **Float**

How much to shift the hue with surface angle. A value of `1` will give maximum hue shift when looking straight-on, and no hue shift cycle when looking side-on. The opposite effect can be achieved with negative values. Higher or lower values will produce more or less hue shift as the surface angle changes, creating the kind of effect seen on some holographic trading cards and iridescent materials.

### Video Texture

- `Type`: **Checkbox**

Enables Video Texture to project on the Decal.

:::warning
This feature enables a Video Texture to appear on the Decal. It will only work if a Video Player is broadcasting a Global Video Texture property.
:::

#### Aspect Ratio

- `Type`: **Dropdown**, Options: `Shrink2Fit`/`Grow2Fit`/`Off`

Determines the Aspect Ratio of the Video Texture. You can specify to either fit within the boundaries of your Decal, or fill in the entire Decal boundaries.

#### Fit To Scale

- `Type`: **Checkbox**

Changes the sizing of the Video Texture to fit to the Scale of the Decal.

#### Use Decal Alpha

- `Type`: **Checkbox**

Uses the Alpha of the Decal for the Video Texture.

#### Only Show Video

- `Type`: **Checkbox**

If enabled, will show ONLY the Video on the Decal.

#### Emission

- `Type`: **Float**, Range: `0.0 - 20.0`

Adjusts the Emissive effect of the Video Texture. Higher values will yield a bloom-like effect in some Worlds.

### Chromatic Aberration

- `Type`: **Checkbox**

Enables a feature that turns the specified Decal into a Chromatic Aberration effect, which splits the colors alongside a specified angle.

#### Intensity

- `Type`: **Float**

Amount of aberration to use, increasing it's distance. Higher values will yield more intense aberration.

#### Surface Angle Intensity

- `Type`: **Float**

Adjusts how the surface influences the Angle intensity.

#### Hue

- `Type`: **Float**, Range: `-1.0 - 1.0`

Modifies the chromatic hue on the aberration.

#### Direction

- `Type`: **Float**, Range: `-3.14 - 3.14`

Adjusts the direction of the aberration.

#### Premultiply Alpha

- `Type`: **Checkbox**

Enables pre-multiplying the Alpha of your Decal for Chromatic Aberration.

### Masking
