**Poiyomi Pro Tessellated** is the Tessellation shader, which includes a shading process that subdivides triangles into a more realistic structure for certain realistic effects.

In DirectX, the Graphics API used on Windows PCs, the primitive in Tessellation is the patch. The patch generates triangle-based tessellation of the areas according to the parameters defined, controlling the degree of fine detail to the mesh. Tessellation is known to be paired with "Phong interpolation," which produces smoother surfaces than what would be generated by the original mesh.

To use Poiyomi Tessellated, select the shader version `.poiyomi/Poiyomi Pro Tessellated`. This exposes the Tessellated category with the following settings shown below.

Tessellation is an expensive feature and can greatly slow down your Graphics Card performance, including the most powerful ones out there!!! Please exercise caution if using it.
