Nearby the top of the Shader, there is a dropdown that changes the Language of the Material UI to a supported language. It makes use of ThryEditor's translation scripts to help translate as many words as possible, with a few manual exceptions.

## Language

- `Type`: **Dropdown**, Options: `English`/`German`/`Japanese`

Currently, Poiyomi Shaders UI supports 3 Languages and can be changed at any time in the UI. The dropdown will affect the Material UI globally.

### English

Text will be presented in American English. This is the Default Language.

### German

Text and Properties will be presented in Deutsch.

### Japanese

Text and Properties will be presented in Japanese.

## Future

We hope to have additional support for more Languages in the future. If you don't see a Language that you prefer, we highly encourage you to help us out! [Join our Discord Server](https://discord.gg/poiyomi) and drop us a line.
