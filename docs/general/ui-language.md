Nearby the top of the Shader, there is a dropdown that changes the Language of the Material UI to a supported language. It makes use of Thry Editor's locale scripts to help translate as many words as possible, with a few manual exceptions.

Text is translated from on an internalized spreadsheet provided by it's locale file, located at `_PoiyomiShaders/Shaders/Poiyomi_Pro_Locale.asset` in Unity. If the material property has supported text for the chosen language, that text will appear in the UI in place of English.

## Language

- `Type`: **Dropdown**, Options: `English`/`German`/`Japanese`

The dropdown will change the text in the Material UI globally to the supported language format.

### English

Text and Properties will be presented in American English. This is the default written language.

### Spanish

### Japanese
