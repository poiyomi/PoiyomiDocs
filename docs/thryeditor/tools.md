Thry Editor includes some integrations that you may end up using while using Poiyomi Shaders. Here are a few known Tools available:

## Fix Keywords

`Thry -> Shader Tools -> Fix Keywords`
Enables / Disables Keywords on all materials depending on the float value of their properties.

:::info
The latest versions of Poiyomi Shaders do a much better handling of Shader Keywords. Therefore, you shouldn't ever need to use this function.

**You should only Fix Keywords if you know what you are doing, or have been instructed to use it.**

## Unlocked Material List

Lists all materials in the project that are unlocked with an option to lock them.

## Flipbooks Creator

Has options to convert a series of textures or a gif into a Flipbook. Flipbooks can be used in shaders e.g. for animated textures.

Using this option requires multi-selecting the file or image sequence, followed by `Right-Click`, navigating to `Thry -> Flipbooks` and choosing an option.
