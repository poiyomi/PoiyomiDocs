title: Custom Penetrators
---

Custom penetrators are split into two categories: Static and Skinned.
- `Skinned` use Skinned Mesh Renderers. They have bones & blendshapes and can use Physbones for dynamics
- `Static` use Static Mesh Renderers. They don't have bones & blendshapes and can't use Physbones for dynamics

## General

Penetrators need their mesh origin to be set at their root. Their forward direction (the blue arrow in unity) should be pointing towards their tip.

## Static

## Skinned
