In worlds with Ambient Occlusion Post Processing, it can have negative effects on the Mesh (especially on the Eyes) when being rendered. This feature can counteract against that by creating a blocking volume on the UV channel.

:::info
Meshes in this UV space render only to depth and act as a blocking volume for effects like Ambient Occlusion. This section affects the UV Tile directly to the left of the default UV. (U -1->0, V 0->1)
