Welcome to the Poiyomi Shaders Documentation! This website provides detailed information about the features currently offered in Poiyomi Shaders and how to utilize them.

Each category and feature documented on the left-hand Sidebar is organized and sorted in descending order, based on the order of appearance in the Shader's User Interface. Use the left-hand Sidebar to navigate (if on Mobile, click the "hamburger" icon).

:::note Shader UI Redirects
All features in the Shader UI will redirect here for further reading. They are indicated by the <FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-circle-question"/> icon on the category header. When clicked on, it will redirect you to the appropriate page on this website.

## Getting Started

### VRChat

Poiyomi Shaders is primarily built for use in VRChat. Make sure you refer to the [VRChat Creators Documentation <FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-square-arrow-up-right"/>](https://creators.vrchat.com/sdk/) for setting up your Project and the SDK in Unity. Use the only supported Unity Version for VRChat (`2022.3.22f1`) and ensure you're always on the latest version of the VRChat SDK (`3.6.0` or higher).

After doing so, follow the instructions found in [Download & Install](/download) to learn how to begin using the Shader in your Project.

### Other Games / System Requirements

:::info
Poiyomi Shaders is primarily built for usage in VRChat. Therefore, limitations may apply when used for other purposes.
:::

If you are a Game Developer or hobbyist wishing to use Poiyomi Shaders on a non-VRChat Project, here are the requirements:
- Supported Unity Versions: `2021.3`, `2022.3`
- Rendering Pipeline: `Built-in Render Pipeline`, `Universal Rendering Pipeline (BETA)`
- Supported Platforms: `Windows`

Please note that this information above are **strict** requirements. We do NOT support the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) in Unity whatsoever.

## Version 9.x

All information in this documentation is geared towards `9.0` and newer. Therefore, this documentation may not apply at all if you are using an older version.

If you are on an older version of Poiyomi Shaders, we highly suggest that you read [**our upgrading guidelines**](/docs/general/upgrade/upgrade.md) in order to ensure you are fully up-to-date on the latest features that are documented here.

## Completion Status

The Documentation now matches version `9.2.67` and newer patches following it. The following features have been added to the Documentation as of late:
- Added Changelogs, separate from the Blog. All changes, both old and new, will be documented here from now on.
  - *Major Updates will still be talked about in the Blog.*
- "Type" properties are accommodated with an icon that matches what it is in the Shader UI.
- Cleaned up some back-end code and got rid of deprecated pages.
- Reorganized sections that were changed in 9.2 to match the Shader UI.
