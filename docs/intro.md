## Documentation

On the sidebar, you'll find Documentation for each different feature of the shader. All features of the Shader in the UI will redirect here for further reading.

:::caution
*This documentation is geared towards* **Poiyomi 8.0 and newer**.

If you're using Poiyomi 7.3 or earlier, this documentation may not apply at all. [**An upgrade guide is available for moving from Poiyomi 7.0 to 8.0+**](/docs/general/v7-upgrade.md).
:::

:::tip Upgrading to 9.0
Poiyomi 9.0 is out now. If you are upgrading from 8.0 to 9.0, a lot of the existing documentation still applies to some extent. Notes are provided if otherwise. [**An upgrade guide is available for moving from Poiyomi 8.0 to 9.0+**](/docs/general/v8-to-v9-upgrade.md)

### Completion Status

:::info
This documentation is continuously being developed! If you have any questions, or if you think you've found an issue, please [join the Discord](https://discord.gg/poiyomi) and ask! Our goal is to have a fully-fleshed out documentation site with rich visual examples and explanations for all of the shader features.

During the creation of this documentation, however, priority is placed on getting text-based documentation complete first, followed by images and videos, so don't panic if it seems like there's a lot of text for now!
