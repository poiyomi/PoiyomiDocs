## Getting Started

### VRChat

Make sure you refer to the [VRChat Creators Documentation](https://creators.vrchat.com/sdk/) for setting up your Project and the SDK in Unity. Use the supported Unity Version for VRChat and ensure you're always on the latest version of the VRChat SDK.

After doing so, simply follow the instructions found in [Download & Install](/download) to learn how to begin using the Shader in your Project.

### Other Games

:::info
Poiyomi Shaders is primarily built for usage in VRChat. Therefore, limitations may apply when used for other purposes.
:::

If you are a Game Developer or hobbyist wishing to use Poiyomi Shaders on a non-VRChat Project, here are the requirements:
- Supported Unity Versions: `2019.4`, `2021.3`, `2022.3 (Recommended)`
- Rendering Pipeline: `Built-in Render Pipeline`
- Build Target: `Windows`

Please note that this information above are **strict** requirements. We do NOT support the Universal Render Pipeline (URP) or High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) in Unity whatsoever.

## Version 9.x

All information in this documentation is geared towards `9.0` and newer. Therefore, this documentation may not apply at all if you are using older versions.

If you are on an older version of Poiyomi Shaders, we highly suggest that you read [**our upgrading guidelines**](/docs/general/upgrade/upgrade.md) in order to ensure you are fully up-to-date on the latest features that are documented here.

## Completion Status

As of January 30, 2025, this Documentation has been greatly updated to match version `9.1.20` of the Shader. We have been hard at work ensuring that all information has been properly addressed and detailed. Not only that, but plenty of new images and rich visual examples have been added! It's a lot better than what it has been since we initially launched this website!

If you have any questions or if you think you've found an issue, please [join the Discord](https://discord.gg/poiyomi) and ask! The Documentation is continuously being edited, updated, and proofread by our contributors, so please don't hesitate to reach out!
