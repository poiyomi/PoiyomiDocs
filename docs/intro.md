Welcome! This website provides all the information you need to know about Poiyomi Shaders and how to use it. This includes Documentation on each feature, as well as other technical functions and utilities included.

:::info Heads Up
Poiyomi Shaders is primarily built for usage in VRChat. However, it may be used in non-VRChat projects provided certain conditions are met. Read below for more information.
:::

## Getting Started

### VRChat

Make sure you refer to the [VRChat Creators Documentation](https://creators.vrchat.com/sdk/) for setting up your Project and the SDK in Unity.

After doing so, simply follow the instructions found in [Download & Install](/download) to learn how to begin using the Shader in your Project.

- Supported Unity Version: `2022.3`
- Rendering Pipeline: `Built-in Render Pipeline (BIRP)`
- Build Target: `Windows, Mac, Linux`

## Documentation

On the sidebar, you'll find Documentation for each different feature of the shader. All features of the Shader in the UI will redirect here for further reading.

:::warning
*This documentation is geared towards* **Poiyomi 8.0 and newer**.

If you're using Poiyomi 7.3 or earlier, this documentation may not apply at all. [**An upgrade guide is available for moving from Poiyomi 7.0 to 8.0+**](/docs/general/v7-upgrade.md).
:::

:::tip Upgrading to 9.0
Poiyomi 9.0 is out now. If you are upgrading from 8.0 to 9.0, a lot of the existing documentation still applies to some extent. Notes are provided if otherwise. [**An upgrade guide is available for moving from Poiyomi 8.0 to 9.0+**](/docs/general/v8-to-v9-upgrade.md)
:::

### Completion Status

This Documentation is continuously being developed! If you have any questions, or if you think you've found an issue, please [join the Discord](https://discord.gg/poiyomi) and ask! Our goal is to have a fully-fleshed out documentation site with rich visual examples and explanations for all of the shader features.

During the creation of this documentation, however, priority is placed on getting text-based documentation complete first, followed by images and videos, so don't panic if it seems like there's a lot of text for now!
