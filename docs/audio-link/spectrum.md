This module allows you to have a fancy spectrum of varying styles that appear with your Audio. It is projected onto the UV of your choice and is scaled to each end of your UV space by default.

## Transform

### UV Mode

- `Type`: **Dropdown**, Options: `Normal`/`Circle`
    - Default: `Normal`

Choice of UV projection of your Spectrum.

<PoiVideo url='/vid/audio-link/ALSpect_NormVSCircle.mp4'/>

- `Normal` is the standard default mode, projected flat on the UV from left to right.
- `Circle` turns it into a more circular-shaped Spectrum while projected on your UV. It is centered by default.

### UV

- `Type`: **Dropdown**, Options: `UV0`/`UV1`/`UV2`/`UV3`/`Panosphere`/`World Pos`/`Local Pos`/`Polar UV`/`Distorted UV`

Choice of UV to use for your Spectrum. You will most likely be configuring this for your specific model.

### Position

- `Type`: **Float2**
    - Default: `X = 0.5`, `Y = 0.5`

Adjusts the Position of the Spectrum's projection on the model's UV space. The Position is based off of the direct center of the projection plane.

| Axis | Function |
| --- | --- |
| X | Position on the UV's X-axis (Left -> Right) |
| Y | Position on the UV's Y-axis (Bottom -> Top) |

### Scale

- `Type`: **Float4**
    - Default: `X = 1`, `Y = 1`, `Z = 1`, `W = 1`

Adjusts the Scale of the Spectrum's projection on the model's UV space.

<PoiVideo url='/vid/audio-link/ALSpect_ScalePos.mp4'/>

| Axis | Function |
| --- | --- |
| X | Scale from the Left-end of the projection |
| Y | Scale from the Right-end of the projection |
| Z | Scale from the Top-end of the projection |
| W | Scale from the Bottom-end of the projection |

### Rotation

- `Type`: **Float**, Range: `0.0 - 360.0`

Rotation of the Spectrum's projection in degrees.

### Rotation Speed

- `Type`: **Float**

Consistent rotation speed of the Spectrum's projection. A value of `1` will result in a complete 360Â° rotation of the Spectrum every 20 seconds.

### Line Width

- `Type`: **Float**, Range: `0.0 - 1.0`
    - Default: `1`

How large the width of the Spectrum should be across the projection.

<PoiVideo url='/vid/audio-link/ALSpect_LineWidth.mp4'/>

- A value of `1` will present ignored width and lock it to remain on the bottom-edge of the projection, resulting in a standard spectrum with empty space overhead.
- A value **less than** `1` will result in a change in the Spectrum's width across the projection. This makes it use the entire space. The locations of where the Bands will move to and from are as it follows:
    - `Top-edge = Full Audio`
    - `Bottom-edge = No Audio`

### Circle Dimensions

- `Type`: **Float4**
    - Default: `X = 0`, `Y = 1`, `Z = 0`, `W = 1`

Adjusts the radius and dimension of the Circle Spectrum, if used.

:::info
This property is only shown if the [UV Mode](#uv-mode) is set to `Circle`.
:::

<PoiVideo url='/vid/audio-link/ALSpect_CircleDimensions.mp4'/>

| Axis | Function |
| --- | --- |
| X | Minimum size of the Circle Spectrum starting from the direct center of the projection |
| Y | Maximum size of the Circle Spectrum |
| Z | Minimum radial clipping of the Circle Spectrum |
| W | Maximum radial clipping of the Circle Spectrum |

## Volume and Band

Adjustment of the UV Space and it's appearance across the Spectrum.

<PoiVideo url='/vid/audio-link/ALSpect_VolBandStepNum.mp4'/>

### Volume

Adjustment of the Volume's UV Space and it's appearance. Goes from Bottom to Top.

<details>
<summary><b>Volume Options</b></summary>

#### Volume Step Num (0 = Off)

- `Type`: **Float**

Determines if the Volume projection should have steps for each set amount of units on the projection.

- A value of `0` sets it uncapped, leaving zero gaps in each step.
- A value greater than `0` will result in a set amount of steps determined by the user.

#### Volume Clip Min

- `Type`: **Float**, Range: `0.0 - 1.0`

Clipping control of the Volume's projection from the Bottom-edge.

#### Volume Clip Max

- `Type`: **Float**, Range: `0.0 - 1.0`

Clipping control of the VOlume's projection from the Top-edge.

</details>

### Band

Adjustment of the Band's UV Space and it's appearance. Goes from Left to Right.

<details>
<summary><b>Band Options</b></summary>

#### Band Step Num (0 = Off)

- `Type`: **Float**

Determines if the Band projection should have steps for each set amount of units on the projection.

- A value of `0` sets it uncapped, leaving zero gaps in each step.
- A value greater than `0` will result in a set amount of steps determined by the user.

#### Band Clip Min

- `Type`: **Float**, Range: `0.0 - 1.0`

Clipping control of the Band's projection from the Left-edge.

#### Band Clip Max

- `Type`: **Float**, Range: `0.0 - 1.0`

Clipping control of the Band's projection from the Right-edge.

</details>

## Shape Clip

- `Type`: **Checkbox**

Enables the ability to provide a set amount of space between each Step for the `Band` or `Volume`, clipping whatever is in-between each step. Use this in conjunction with your [Volume Step Num](#volume-step-num-0--off) and [Band Step Num](#band-step-num-0--off) values to achieve a digital visualizer look.

:::tip Works best with Steps
Shape Clip should use a [Volume Step Num](#volume-step-num-0--off) and [Band Step Num](#band-step-num-0--off) with a value greater than `0` for this to appear correctly.

### Volume Width

- `Type`: **Float**, Range: `0.0 - 1.0`

Width of the space between each step on the Volume.

- A value of `0` is wider spacing and fully clipped.
- A value of `0.5` shows visible clipping between each space by a factor of `0.5` units.
- A value of `1` shows no visible clipping between each space whatsoever.

### Band Width

- `Type`: **Float**, Range: `0.0 - 1.0`

Width of the space between each step on the Band.

- A value of `0` is wider spacing and fully clipped.
- A value of `0.5` shows visible clipping between each space by a factor of `0.5` units.
- A value of `1` shows no visible clipping between each space whatsoever.

## Audio Mods

Modifier for increasing or decreasing the sensitivity of the Spectrum from each Band. This will greatly influence how the Spectrum appears in the projection.

<PoiVideo url='/vid/audio-link/ALSpect_AudMods.mp4'/>

### Volume

- `Type`: **Float**
    - Default: `0.5`

Adjusts the sensitivity of the Volume Band. Higher values will yield larger Spectrums.

### Bass Boost

    - Default: `5`

Adjusts the sensitivity of the Bass Band. Higher values will yield increased reaction to the Bass on the Spectrum.

### Treble Boost

- `Type`: **Float**
    - Default: `1`

Adjusts the sensitivity of the Treble Band. Higher values will yield increased reaction to the the Treble on the Spectrum.

## Colors and Blending
