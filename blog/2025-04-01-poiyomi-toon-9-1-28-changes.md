Not an April Fools Joke, thankfully. This update addresses a critical issue that slipped in, causing compiler issues in the VRChat Worlds SDK. The Toon version is now available in the VCC Repository, GitHub, and on BOOTH.

### Fixes
- Fixed a definition error caused by the IDE in ThryEditor, breaking the VRChat Worlds SDK.
