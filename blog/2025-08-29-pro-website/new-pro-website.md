Patreon Subscribers, we have something special for you!

As of today, you can now download Poiyomi Pro from our new dedicated website. This will be the new place where you can obtain the latest versions of Poiyomi Pro without needing Discord.

## How To Use The New Website

### About Discord

From this point forward, you will still need to link your Patreon with your Discord Account in order to receive tech support from our Discord server. As always, linking your Patreon to your Discord will unlock a fancy role, some perks, and access to the `#paid-shader` channel where you can also download the same package from.

## VCC Support Coming Soon!

This new website is the first steps in creating a VCC-compatible version of the Pro shader! Support for this is currently under development and should hopefully be available soon for all Patreons to use in the near future.

We hope you enjoy using the new website! As always, thank you for being a Patreon subscriber!
