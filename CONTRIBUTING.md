# Contributing to the Documentation

It is recommended you utilize your own branches when making changes. Having branches will help you stay organized and ensure your edits are easier to manage. So before you get started, fork this repository!

> [!CAUTION]
> **DO NOT INCLUDE YOUR GENERATED LOCK FILES IN YOUR BRANCHES!** Lock files are automatically generated by your package managers and can create PR conflicts!
>
> We cannot allow PRs that overwrite lock files due to the sensitive nature those files serve in the website deployment. They should only be modified when upgrading and/or adding Docusaurus and React plugins.

## Docs

All pages in the Documentation are sorted under `/docs`. The file and organization structure should represent close to the order of appearance in the Poiyomi Shaders UI.

Each Documentation page uses the MDX format so that both written content and embedded media can be easily implemented. To learn how to create a Docs page and how they appear on the website itself, read the official documentation [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/docs-introduction).

## Pages

Some pages, that require it's own landing page (like the Home page) are created when truly necessary. However, the main difference is that Pages never have Sidebars. Read more [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/creating-pages).

## Blog Posts

For those active in this project, the main Blog is located in the folder `/blog`. This is where Tips, Tricks, and helpful articles will be posted in. Reference: [Blog on Docusaurus Documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog)

Creating a Blog Post requires a few things:

- Your Name and info in the `authors.yml` file, located inside the `/blog` folder. Use currently-added Authors for reference.
- Must be in Markdown format.
- The prefix of the document name must be `YYYY-MM-DD-` for the Date of the post (Year, Month, Day).
  - *Example: `2025-08-30-my-blog-post.md` for the date to be August 30, 2025.*
- A header in the post containing:
  - `slug:` - The URL-friendly name of the page. Optional. If empty, will assume the name of the file as the default.
    - *Note: The slug should be used if the name of the document doesn't follow the recommended prefix above.*
  - `title:` - The H1 Heading name of your Blog Post.
    - *Example: `title: My Blog Post`*
  - `description:` - A short description of the context of the Blog post. Important for SEO!
    - *Example: `description: This is my short description.`*
  - `hide_table_of_contents: true` - This should be marked `true` to keep things clean.
  - `authors:` - This should be your name as specified in the `authors.yml` file. Shows who wrote this post.
    - *Example: `authors: myname`*
  - `tags: []` - Search-friendly tags to add. Each should be a single word separated by a comma. Important for SEO!
    - *Example: `tags: [blog, post, subject]`*
- Compliance with the Docusaurus Blogging system.

After you create a named Markdown file in the `/blog` folder and followed the requirements stated above, you can then start writing!

In order to follow Markdown compliance, make sure you follow the Basic Syntax guidelines when formatting your text: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/.

### Attaching Images

*see [Embedding Media](#embedding-media) for reference.*

If your Blog Post contains images, put your Blog post inside a folder instead! To do this, you will instead create a folder named appropriately (to match the document name) and place your Markdown file inside of it.

Example: `/blog/2025-08-30-my-blog-post/my-blog-post.md`

You can then add an image inside the same folder directory. Add as many images as you need.

To show them in your post, use the Markdown syntax as found here: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#images-1. Since the image will be in the same folder as your post, the path to the image should just be the name of the file itself.

Make sure you specify the Alt text as described in the Markdown syntax. This is important for SEO!

## Changelogs

There is a sub-blog located under `/changelog`, where patch notes and major update changes should be notated. Unfortunately there is no automation since Docusaurus is static-generated, so changelogs must be published manually.

When creating changelogs, please follow the following formatting:

- Name the document with the prefix `YYYY-MM-DD-` for the Date of the post (Year, Month, Day), followed by `poiyomi-toon-` and ending with the version number.
  - *Example: `2025-09-26-poiyomi-toon-9.2.79-changelog.md`. The date in this example is September 26, 2025.*
- Must be in Markdown format.
- Header should be exactly:
  - `title:` - Should be the name of the shader followed by a version number and ending with "changelog" as the title.
    - *Example: `title: Poiyomi Toon 9.2.79 Changelog`*
  - `description:` - A short description about the update. Typically you can get away with saying that it contains information about the update.
    - *Example: `description: Information regarding the release of Poiyomi Toon 9.2.79.`*
  - `hide_table_of_contents: true` - This should be marked `true` to keep things clean.
  - `authors:` - This should be your name as specified in the `authors.yml` file. Most of the time though, `poiyomi` will write these changelogs.
    - *Example: `authors: poiyomi`*
  - `tags: []` - Search-friendly tags to add. Put in `poiyomi, shader, vrchat, update, updates`. Put in `free` if it affects the Free version, and/or put in `pro` if it affects the Pro version.
    - *Example: `tags: [poiyomi, shader, vrchat, update, updates, free]`
- Compliance with the Docusaurus blogging system.

To start with the written portion, feel free to go straight to the point and make a list notating each change. If you wanna be a little more professional, feel free to add a friendly sentence prior to making the list.

## Embedding Media

This documentation has implemented some React plugins that can assist in certain media to be properly embedded. It is important you use them in order for them to appear correctly.

### YouTube Videos

In pages where a YouTube video needs to be attached, you must use our specific `videobox` css class for YouTube videos to embed correctly. Additionally, the `nocookie` attribute must be used to ensure embeds are free of tracked cookies.

Copy & Paste this code format below, then replace the `{VIDEO-ID}` part with the YouTube Video ID (without the brackets). The Video ID is found in the YouTube URL that follows `watch?v=` and before it hits `&list=` if it's in a playlist.

```
<div class="videobox">
<iframe class="iframe-element" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/{VIDEO-ID}?si=TO5iXVR7NWWw4xNw" title="YouTube Video Player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
```

For example, the YouTube Video for this Audio Link Tutorial from Sipp's Avatar Box is `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gp1woO9RzGY`. You must convert this URL to `https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Gp1woO9RzGY?si=TO5iXVR7NWWw4xNw` in the `src=` so that Cookies are removed. As a reference point, the ID should match between what follows `watch?v=` and `embed/` in the URLs. The Anti-Cookie Parameter that then follows it is `?si=TO5iXVR7NWWw4xNw`.

### Hosted Video

If you are attaching a video file into the Documentation, please ensure you place it somewhere under `/static/vid` folder in the repository. Then, use the plugin `ReactVideo` and expose it in-line:

```
<ReactVideo src='/vid/{YOUR VIDEO FILE}'/>
```

Replace the `{YOUR VIDEO FILE}` (without the brackets) with the actual link to the file.

Example (this is used near the top of the Audio Link Docs page):

```
<ReactVideo src='/vid/audio-link/ALDemo-MYB.webm'/>
```

### Attaching Images

You can easily attach images using the Markdown argument `![Alt Text](/img/your-image.png)`. Make sure the source image is sorted under `static/img/`. Otherwise, this may not work.

### Other Static Assets

Read the official Docusaurus documentation on [Static Assets](https://docusaurus.io/docs/static-assets).
